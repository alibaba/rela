# Rela - Validating in-production network changes with few-lines specification
Rela is a tool for checking the correctness of network changes. It provides:
- A domain-specific language for users to describe end-to-end change impacts in a few lines.
- A verifier to check whether a network change implementation satisfies the user's specification.

## Install Rela
Rela supports only Python version 3.7 at this time. To install Rela, run the following from the root directory of this repo.
```sh
$ pip install .
```

## Using Rela
See [here](examples/demo.ipynb) for a running example.
